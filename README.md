# Stefan Rosinski: Habit Coaching

**[RosinskiCoaching](https://www.rosinskicoaching.de)** was made with Sass. Sass is great, flexible, and *known*: making it great as a standard. I know some poeple prefer SCSS but I am (currently—hopefully not much longer) using a german keyboard, this means having to type Braces, Brackets, and Parenthesies all the time is *extremely* taxing. I would have also considered using Stylus, Less, or something in that manner, but as mentioned previously, they are not as known and one of my goals with this project was to make it usable (or atleast readable) by most people—that is, people who know CSS basics (which is probably better than me; this is what is known as a *noob* project…).

I would have liked to create this with Ruby on Rails, but Github-Pages is not compatible with that kind of fancy-ness, so I'm stuck with plain-old-vanilla-a.k.a.-boring index.html. *If* I **had** used Rails though, I would have probably paired it with HAML (*so elegant… noticably blushes*). Man I love Ruby's style, its idealogy even—it just somehow makes working on these kind of things *fun* (I know right? It feels so *alien*…).

Finally I should mention that even though CSS-grid is inherently better, that doesn't mean that you should use it exclusively. Maybe also use Flexbox sometimes...? *I mean—you don't have to… but you should.* OK, that's it. Bye. Oh, and “I use Arch BTW.”
